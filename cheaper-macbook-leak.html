                <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Could this be the affordable MacBook we've been waiting for?</figcaption>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Heads up, Apple fans and budget hunters! Whispers are getting louder that Apple is secretly working on a brand-new, more affordable MacBook line, possibly hitting shelves for <strong>under $999</strong>. This juicy rumor comes from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who suggests this budget-friendly MacBook, powered by an <strong>iPhone chip</strong>, could drop by late 2025 or early 2026.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Now, here's where it gets interesting: unlike most MacBooks that run on their own M-series chips (think M1, M2, M3), this rumored cheaper version might pack an <strong>A18 Pro chip</strong>. Yep, that's the *same* chip expected to power the iPhone 16 Pro!</p>

            <figure class="my-8 text-center">
                <img src="https://asset.kompas.com/crops/e6IaqvIhcFMu_wSFa_CVVOUxRmg=/195x68:1005x608/750x500/data/photo/2024/09/10/66df8183a08a8.png" class="mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-md max-w-full h-auto" alt="Apple A18 Pro Chip">
                <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Apple A18 Pro Chip expected to power the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max (GSMArena)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">This move looks like Apple's smart play to slash production costs and open up the MacBook market to a much wider audience, especially students and first-time laptop buyers. The word on the street is this budget MacBook will sport a <strong>13-inch display</strong> and come in a <strong>few color options</strong>. It’s also expected to be even <strong>thinner and lighter than the current MacBook Air</strong>, though we're still in the dark about other tech specs like RAM, storage, or battery life.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Kuo even hinted that Apple is planning to churn out between 5 to 7 million units in 2026, which pretty much screams confidence in this affordable MacBook's appeal.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">First Mac with an iPhone Chip?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">If these rumors pan out, this MacBook would be the <strong>very first Mac to use an iPhone chip</strong> instead of the usual M-series. The A18 Pro itself is built on TSMC’s second-gen 3nm process, promising better power efficiency and souped-up AI performance.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Early benchmark leaks show the A18 Pro chip hitting a single-core score of around 3500 and a multi-core score of about 8780. That puts it right up there with the early M1 chip from 2020. What does that mean for you? Well, that kind of power is more than enough for everyday tasks like web <strong>Browse</strong>, document editing, video streaming, and even some light photo editing without any significant slowdowns. Most average users won't feel a thing!</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Why This Makes Sense for Apple</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Apple hasn’t officially commented on these rumors, but analysts are saying this move totally makes sense. It would let Apple fill a gap in the market between the iPad and the MacBook Air, and also go head-to-head with Chromebooks, which are super popular with students right now.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">According to KompasTekno (via Toms Hardware, Sunday, July 6, 2025), this device is also expected to run the <strong>full macOS operating system</strong>, not iPadOS. That’s key – it means you’re still getting the full Apple computing experience.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">If this rumor turns out to be true, launching a cheaper MacBook with an iPhone chip would be a seriously innovative move for Apple, shaking up their product line strategy big time. After all, Apple has never released a MacBook priced <strong>under $999</strong> (the current cheapest MacBook Air M2 starts higher). With this new model, it looks like they’re finally ready to jump into the truly affordable laptop territory.</p>
