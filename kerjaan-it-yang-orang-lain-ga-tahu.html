 .</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h2>1. Coding is Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "When I started my first job as a developer, I thought I'd be writing code
      all day. But it turns out, the majority of my time is spent in
      meetings, clarifying requirements with clients, debugging, and reviewing
      teammates’ work. The actual coding part is less than half the job."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Alice, Fullstack Developer</div>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Debugging Can Be a Real Nightmare</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "I once spent three days chasing a bug that was caused by a tiny typo in
      a config file. It made me realize that patience and attention to detail
      are as important as coding skills. Sometimes, finding the bug is harder
      than fixing it."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Rahul, Backend Engineer</div>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Documentation is Your Best Friend (Even if It Feels Boring)</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "I used to avoid writing documentation because it felt like a waste of
      time. But when I had to take over a legacy project with zero docs, I
      realized how painful it was. Now, I always document my code and processes
      so that others don’t suffer the same pain."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Sophia, Software Architect</div>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Soft Skills Matter More Than You Think</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "Tech skills got me hired, but my ability to communicate and collaborate
      well with others got me promoted. Being able to explain complex ideas in
      simple terms is one of the most valuable skills you can have."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— James, Dev Team Lead</div>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Security is Everyone’s Job</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "Even as a frontend developer, I learned early on that security basics like
      input validation and protecting sensitive data are critical. One small
      security flaw can lead to a big disaster."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Lina, Frontend Engineer</div>
  </div>

  <h2>6. Learning Never Stops</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "The tech world moves so fast, you have to keep learning or get left
      behind. I spend a few hours every week just exploring new frameworks,
      tools, and best practices. It’s a never-ending journey."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— David, Cybersecurity Specialist</div>
  </div>

  <h2>7. Remote Work Isn’t Always Chill</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "Working remotely sounded amazing at first, but managing my schedule,
      avoiding distractions, and staying connected with my team was way harder
      than I expected. It took me months to find a rhythm that worked."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Maria, Product Manager</div>
  </div>

  <h2>8. Version Control is a Life Saver</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "I learned git the hard way. Once I accidentally overwrote an entire
      project branch and had no idea how to recover it. Now, I swear by version
      control. It’s like a time machine for your code."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Eric, Junior Developer</div>
  </div>

  <h2>9. Impostor Syndrome is Real, But You Can Beat It</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "I constantly felt like I wasn’t good enough, even after years in the
      field. Talking to mentors and peers helped me realize that almost everyone
      feels this way. Confidence comes with experience and support."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Nina, QA Engineer</div>
  </div>

  <h2>10. Burnout is a Serious Risk</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "I pushed myself too hard to deliver on tight deadlines and ended up
      burned out. Now, I prioritize mental health, take breaks, and set healthy
      boundaries. Your brain needs rest to keep creating."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Tom, Software Engineer</div>
  </div>

  <h2>11. Testing Is Not Optional</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "Skipping tests to save time feels tempting, but it always backfires. I've
      faced countless bugs in production because of missing tests. Automated
      testing has saved me so much headache."
    </p>
    <div class="author">— Chloe, QA Specialist</div>
  </div>

  <h2>12. Real Projects are Messier Than Tutorials</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      "Tutorials show neat, small projects. Real-world apps? They're messy,
      complicated, and require dealing with legacy code, unexpected bugs, and
      changing requirements. Patience and flexibility are key."
